# Smart-Waste-Segregation-Recycling-with-Reward-System
India generates over 62 million tonnes of municipal solid waste annually, but only a fraction is segregated and recycled. Improper waste segregation leads to:
1.	Overflowing landfills
2.	Soil and water pollution
3.	Loss of recyclable resources
4.	Minimal public awareness and motivation

Current waste management systems lack citizen engagement, proper incentives, and effective tracking mechanisms.
